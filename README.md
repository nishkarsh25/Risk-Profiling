<h3 style="color: darkcyan">Simulation of Temperature Distributions:</h3>

<p style="color: darkgreen">The code generates a simulated dataset of temperature readings, where each temperature distribution has a mean value and standard deviation randomly assigned within a certain range. The distributions are then plotted using a histogram to visualize the data.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkcyan">Probability of Error:</h3>

<p style="color: darkgreen">The code calculates the probability of an error occurring given a true temperature value, by checking the number of readings outside a certain range of +/- 0.3 degrees from the true temperature value. The probability of error is calculated for each temperature value, and a histogram is plotted to visualize the distribution.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkcyan">Expected Cost:</h3>

<p style="color: darkgreen">The code calculates the expected cost of error, given the probability of error and the cost associated with each temperature value. The cost values are randomly assigned within certain ranges based on the temperature value, and the expected cost is calculated by taking the product of the probability of error, probability of each temperature value, and the associated cost value.</p>
